I am a Data Scientist at Vevo. My main focus thus far has been forecasting various quantities. Views, Watch Time, Revenue, etc. 

All of our data is observational, which poses significant challenges. My goal for this year is to learn & implement quasi-experimental methods. Also, our Youtube data is longitudinal, which I think is an interesting & yet unexplored path.

Prior to Vevo I worked in the Sports & Horse wagering industry. The first two places I was employed had a total workforce of 4 & 10, respectively. So, I gained a lot of experience building (everything) from the ground up. Some of the topics I spent time on were yield optimization, ensembling methods, ranking algorthims, & data engineering.
