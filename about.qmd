## Hello

My name is Vincenzo Palazeti, but everyone calls me Vinnie.

I am a Data Scientist at Vevo. My main focus thus far has been forecasting various quantities. Views, Watch Time, Revenue, etc. 

Prior to Vevo I worked in the Sports & Horse wagering industries. Some of the topics I've spent time on are yield optimization, ensembling methods, ranking algorthims, timeseries, experimental methods, & data engineering.

All of our data is observational, which poses significant challenges. My goal for this year is to learn & implement quasi-experimental methods. Also, our Youtube data is longitudinal, which I think is an interesting & yet unexplored path.
